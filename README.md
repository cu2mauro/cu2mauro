- 👋 Hi, I’m @cu2mauro
- 👀 I’m interested in High Energy Theoretical Physics, particularly in Holography and Phase Transitions
- 🌱 I’m currently learning scientific computing on Python, Julia, MATLAB, and Mathematica, but I'm still getting started
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything physics that needs numerical power, or that can teach me some new numerical techniques
- 📫 You can reach me at mauro.giliberti(at)unifi.it
